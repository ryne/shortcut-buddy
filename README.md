# Shortcut Buddy
OpenAI-powered tool for learning keyboard shortcuts. Built on [Vite + ReactJs + TailwindCSS](https://github.com/KrishGarg/vite-react-tailwind-jit-template).

## USAGE
Requires an [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/signup) to perform fetch requests (my trial key expired unfortunately.)

- Go to [OpenAI's registration page](https://beta.openai.com/signup) and create a new account. OpenAI is very generous, offering a free trial with $18 credit to work with over the course of a month.

- Once registered, you can create a new secret key by accessing your [API Keys page](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) within your account.

- Simply paste your newly-created key into the extremely modern JS Prompt to initialize the app for awesome shortcut digging. Enjoy!
